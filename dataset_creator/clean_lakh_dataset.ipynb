If we find a match, we will save a `.json` file with the same name as the MIDI file including the song's name, artist, and most importantly, the LastFM tags. These tags will be crucial later on as they contain descriptive data, such as the emotional tone of the song, that would be impossible to derive from the `.mid` file or its future `.wav` rendering alone. Tags often include words like \"melancholic\", \"warm\", or \"gentle\", which users assign to songs.

    "Spotify provides additional metadata that is highly useful for this dataset. First, it offers general musical information such as key, mode, and tempo (e.g., \"A Major, 129 BPM\"). Additionally, Spotify provides descriptive parameters like \"acousticness\", \"danceability\", and \"energy\". Another crucial piece of metadata is the track's sections. Spotify defines sections as \"large variations in rhythm or timbre, e.g., chorus, verse, bridge, guitar solo, etc.\" Each section includes its own descriptions of tempo, key, mode, time signature, and loudness.\n",

    "This is particularly interesting for our project because rendering the entire song into a single `.wav` file typically results in 2 to 4-minute-long files, but for our model, we want shorter audio clips. This means we need to cut the `.wav` files, but doing so every N seconds could lead to abrupt cuts or starting a clip in the middle of a musical phrase. The section data is ideal for our use case, allowing us to cut the audio into smaller, coherent pieces. Sections are typically 10-30 seconds long, which aligns with our requirements."
